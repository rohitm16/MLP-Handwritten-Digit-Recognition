# Handwritten Digit Recognition from Scratch (NumPy)

A raw implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network using only Python and NumPy. This project implements Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Backpropagation without using Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Inspired by Michael Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" and the 3Blue1Brown Deep Learning series.

## 🧠 Features
*   **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** architecture.
*   **Vanishing Gradient** handling (conceptually) via Sigmoid activation.
*   **Stochastic Gradient Descent** optimizer built from scratch.
*   **Backpropagation** algorithm implementation using chain rule derivatives.
*   **MNIST Dataset** integration (95%+ accuracy).
